A transaction with Stockanow will happen through the following steps:

The informal retailer downloads the Stockanow app and creates an account.
The retailer browses through the available products on the app and selects the items they want to purchase.
The app will show the retailer the total cost of the purchase, including any applicable taxes and delivery fees.
The retailer confirms the purchase and makes payment through the app using their preferred payment method, such as a debit card or mobile money.
The app sends the order to the selected wholesaler, who prepares the items for delivery.
Then Stockanow drivers pick up the order and deliver the items to the retailer's location, as per the agreed delivery schedule.
The retailer receives the items and confirms the delivery through the app.
The app releases the payment to the wholesaler, and the transaction is complete.
